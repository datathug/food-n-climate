Now give me geographic references in national language for municipalities that belong to a PDO in {country},
where {product_name} is produced. This product was classified as {product_type} in the EU nomenclature.
Format your message so that each municipality is mentioned along with a province or state it is located in,
in the same record after comma. Country name in its own language must be present last.
Format output as an enumerated list.
